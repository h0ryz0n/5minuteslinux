# a quick guide to setting firewall to protect machines or your network with ProxMox #

## INTRODUCTION
provided ProxMox is netfilter based, you can use the builtin firewall for simple configuration, to offload some packet analysis from your router/gw cpu
# todo: more general guide with iptables-nftables command lines

## VM vs CT
for a better protection, it's suggested to use VM instead of CT/LXC, because full virtualization provides a better decoupling from the host machine
but it needs more resources, hence is always a trade-off

## DROP vs REJECT
REJECT gives an answer to the packet (like "No reachable")
DROP just 

assuming your guests have same IP class of your internal network

# total isolation (trivial)
default block all IN
default block all OUT

# minimal access (dmz-like)
allow ssh IN from lan
allow dns OUT to lan-gw/dns server
block OUT to lan
default allow all OUT

# minimal proxmox server management
allow ssh IN from lan
allow tcp IN 8006 from lan
allow dns OUT to lan-gw/dns server
default allow all OUT
