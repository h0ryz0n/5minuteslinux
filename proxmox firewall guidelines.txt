# fast & simple guidelines to protect your guests and setting firewall for your network with ProxMox #
# TODO: more general networking guide with iptables-nftables command lines

## TRADE-OFFS:

# HYPERVISOR FIREWALL vs GATEWAY FIREWALL for GUESTS
PROXMOX FIREWALL - netfilter based, good for simple configuration, offloads packet analysis from your router/gw
GATEWAY FIREWALL - best for complex configurations, especially if equipped with good firewall software that can be updated (pfSense, IPFire...)

# VM vs CT
VM provides better decoupling from host machine, but uses more resources
CT/LXC are faster to deploy and handle

# DROP vs REJECT
REJECT answers back (ex. ICMP type 3 - 'Destination unreachable'), making aware of target's online state
DROP just ignores the packet, the sender waits until timeout

# assuming your guests have same IP class of your internal network

# total isolation (trivial)
default block all IN
default block all OUT

# nearly-total isolation from LAN (dmz) - need external dns server (ex. 1.1.1.1)
allow IN ports (exposed services)
block all OUT to lan
default allow all OUT
default block all IN

# minimal access (dmz-like)
allow IN ports (exposed services)
allow ssh IN from lan
allow dns OUT to lan-gw/dns server
block OUT to lan
default allow all OUT
default block all IN

# minimal proxmox server management
allow ssh IN from lan
allow tcp IN 8006 from lan
default allow all OUT
default block all IN
