## proxmox dirty tricks: resize a partition on the fly  ##

assuming you want to add +1GB on a vm with vmid '102', vmdisk 'scsi0' and partition in the vm is /dev/sda3

# from proxmox shell
qm resize 102 scsi0 +1G
# start shell on vm, you may need to install e2fsprogs/e2fsprogs-extra package
cfdisk /dev/sda
# from cfdisk: select partition -> Resize -> write new size, the select Write and go back to shell
resize2fs /dev/sda3
# reboot the machine
# it's wise to do a fsck on the resized file system
