# How to have host access and internet access for your VM Linux/BSD appliance in VirtualBox in 30 seconds
# make backups and restart network services afterwards
# interface names are usually enp0sX but can be vtnetX if you choose to paravirtualize, examples have both

## VBox setup ##
VM -> Settings -> Network

[Adapter 1]
NAT

[Adapter 2]
Attached to: Host-only Adapter
Name: VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter

## from VBox, reboot VM and get root ##


### Linux ### src for Debian: https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html ###

# check network interfaces - usually enpXsX but can be vtnetX if you choose to paravirtualize

> ip a

1: lo: ....
2: enp0s3: ... inet 10.0.X.X    ... state UP     # this is the NAT
3: enp0s8: ... inet 192.168.X.X ... state DOWN   # this is the host-only

*add where necessary in /etc/network/interfaces:
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
allow-hotplug enp0s8
iface enp0s8 inet dhcp

> systemctl restart networking.service
#get the IPs with:
> ip a s enp0s3 | grep inet
> ip a s enp0s8 | grep inet

#check the NAT is the default route
> ip r

default via 10.0.x.x dev enp0s3    # VBOX NAT interface



### BSD ### src for FreeBSD: https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/network/ ###

# check network interfaces
> ifconfig -a

1: lo: ....

3: vtnet1: ... inet 192.168.X.X ... state DOWN   # this is the host-only

*add where necessary in /etc/rc.conf:
ifconfig_vtnet0="DHCP"
ifconfig_vtnet1="DHCP"

> service netif restart && service routing restart && service dhclient restart vtnet0 && service dhclient restart vtnet1

#check the NAT interface has the default route
