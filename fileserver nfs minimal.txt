#NFS: minimalistic no-hassle no-frills file server for selective sharing on your LAN
tested on debian 9+
for more infos: "man nfs"

#assuming you have:
- root access
- typed 'rpcinfo -p' and verified that "mountd" and "nfs" are displayed
- some mounts you want to share on /media/*
- as an example, server ip as 192.168.0.5

# SERVER SIDE #

apt install nfs-kernel-server

#nfs configuration
*in /etc/exports:

#read only export for everyone on this network

#read write for another net with selected class ips (1-14)
/media/HD/upload    192.168.1.0/28(rw)
#you can put multiple ip in one row
/media/HD/images   192.168.0.0/24(ro) 192.168.1.0(ro)
