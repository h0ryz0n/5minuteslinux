#NFS: minimalistic no-hassle no-frills file server for selective sharing on your LAN
tested on debian 9+
for more infos: "man nfs"

#assuming you have:
- root access
- typed 'rpcinfo -p' and verified that "mountd" and "nfs" are displayed
- some mounts you want to share on /media/*
- as an example, server ip as 192.168.0.5

# SERVER SIDE #

#nfs installation
apt install nfs-kernel-server

#nfs configuration
*in /etc/exports:

#read only export for everyone on this network
/media/HD/files		192.168.0.0/24(ro)
#read write for another net with selected class ips (1-14)
/media/HD/upload    192.168.1.0/28(rw)
#you can put multiple ip in one row
/media/HD/images   192.168.0.0/24(ro) 192.168.1.0(ro)

# TROUBLESHOOTING #
if you note unexpected behaviour, watch the log, usually:
/var/log/minidlna.log

# max_user_watches is not enough
monitor.c:222: warn: WARNING: Inotify max_user_watches [xxxxx] is low or close to the number of used watches [xxxx] and I do not have permission to increase this limit.  Please do so manually by writing a higher value into /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watche
# solution: increase the value of max_user_watches
*in /etc/sysctl.conf:
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 15000
# then reboot or 'sysctl -p'

# can't scrape metadata
scanner.c:489: warn: Unsuccessful getting details for /.../.../filename
# chances are that file is corrupted or wrong extension, double check file
