# NEXTCLOUD TROUBLESHOOTING SMB EXTERNAL STORAGE MOUNTS WITH OLD SMBCLIENT VERSIONS
Nextcloud seems not to mount correctly Samba shares as 'External storages'
this happens if you have a rather old smbclient version and you disabled SMB1 for security purposes
if you updated your OS and Nextcloud to last version, you don't need this fix
when this happens, the typical log entry in NC is:
"[no app in context] Error: Icewind\SMB\Exception\ConnectionException: Connection not valid at <<closure>>"


#the story
after doing some research, turns out that when disabling SMB1 (min protocol = SMB2 in smb.conf),
some older smbclient versions (4.5.x) just can't auto negotiate protocol properly, unless forced with -m SMB2/3
results are either NT_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_MIX or NT_STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE
I tested with either smbclient 4.5.16(deb9) and smbclient 4.9.5(deb10) on same Samba servers
with smbclient 4.9.5 the problem goes away, regardless of smb server version


#a quick & dirty fix
this workaround works in debian 9 + smbclient with SMB1 disabled, simply forces a SMB protocol when mounting External storages
forcing a SMB3 mount fixes the NT_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_MIX/INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE
which prevents Nextcloud External Storages to mount SMB2/3 shares with some old smbclient versions (4.5.x)
these versions seem to have issues on auto-negotiation when SMB1 is disabled (min protocol = SMB2 in /etc/samba/smb.conf)


#TLDR
you just need to change a row in a nextcloud php file and restart the web server

*in /srv/www/nextcloud/apps/files_external/3rdparty/icewind/smb/src/Wrapped/Share.php:

        protected function getConnection() {
                $command = sprintf(
                // DIRTY FIX to make it work with SMBv2/3
                //      '%s%s -t %s %s %s %s',
                        '%s%s -t %s %s %s %s -m SMB3',
                // END OF FIX
