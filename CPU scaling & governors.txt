Just a quick, raw cheat sheet of cpu frequencies scaling and monitoring  
works on debian/_buntu/arch/fedora & derivatives  
  
## CPU info & monitoring  
cpupower frequency-info  #drivers: acpi-cpufreq: old legacy driver - amd-pstate/intel-pstate are newer ones  
cpupower monitor  
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "cpu MHz"  
sensors  
powertop  
turbostat  
  
## governors & scaling frequencies  
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor #base governor  
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq  
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq  
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference #amd epp  
  
## example of setting base governor & amd pstate epp  
cpupower frequency-set --min 1.72GHz -max 3.33GHz --governor performance  #base governor  
echo performance | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference  #enhanced cpu firmware governor  
  
## TIPS & TRICKS  
avoid setting min frequency lower than the specified "lowest non-linear frequency", usually around 1.72/2GHz: it causes deep cpu c-states, audio stuttering and random micro-freezes
