# 5minuteslinux
random 5 minutes tutorials for building things on Linux

"Linux is difficult" said the typical Windows/Mac user
but years passing, Linux distros are becoming more and more popular among users, mostly because of user-friendly graphical interfaces.
some of these distros are Linux Mint, MX Linux, Zorin, Elementary, Peppermint
you can google thousands of them, which brings us to "paradox of choice" and "distro hopping" phenomena, which are out of scope of this description.

what still frighten most people is the infamous 'terminal', the bogeyman of the average user
it may seem scaring to approach to thousands manual pages, tutorials, help text and configuration files
some think it may need hours to learn the bases and has some sort of mental block approaching this powerful instrument
some just run shell scripts and commands without knowing what they are doing
because they just feel disoriented to a new language and don't want to spend time reading

this repository is dedicated to lazy people like me:
the scope is to demostrate 5 minutes solutions on common problems and quick explanations on topics which may be object of curiosity
I will try to cut everything to the bone, whilst keeping some theory and leaving room and sources to go deep
as a desired effect, we will chip away the usual mental blocks which affects who approaches these powerful instruments for the first time.
